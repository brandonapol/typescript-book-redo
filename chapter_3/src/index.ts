//* any
// can do any type, but it basically means you're not using the tools right

//* unknown
// won't let you use these types until you check what it is; you have to prove to JS that you know what it is
// use typeof to check / prove

//* boolean
// Type literals: Type that supports one value and nothing else. 
let a: true = true; // Is a boolean type literal

//* number
// When you use let x = 27 it becomes type number
// when you use const x = 27 it becomes type 27

//* bigint 
// Todo - research this more

//* string

//* symbol
// Unique - even if a= Symbol(1) and b = Symbol(1), a ==b will return false

//* Objects
// Objects should be inferred, or otherwise you have to tell the object the type of every value inside it
// object is very vague so TS will try to play security - it wants us to be specific!
// objects are still very much mutable in TS

let aa: {b: number}; // aka 'let aa be an object that contains a number b'

// aa = {};
aa = {
    b: 1,
    // c: 2,
}

// Try and design programs so arrays have all the same type! TS will only allow 
// union data types in an array if you explicitly tell it to

let bb = [1, 'a'] // (string | number)
// readonly arrays - immutable

//* null - absence of value
//* undefined - variable that hasn't been given a value yet
//* void - function that doesn't have a return statement
//* never - function that doesn't return ever

// TypeScript's error codes are very specific, and easy to google!
